Overview
Welcome to the Java Lab Sheet! This document is designed to guide you through fundamental Java concepts, divided into four comprehensive modules. Whether you're a beginner or looking to strengthen your Java skills, these modules will provide you with practical exercises and valuable insights.


Module 1 - Introduction to Java        
Write the following programs using Scanner class and Control Statements:    
Q1. Write a program to accept the length of two line segments and check whether they are equal or unequal. Display the message accordingly.    Requirements:      a) Read the length of two line segments from user.   
b) Display “Equal” if they are equal otherwise “Not Equal”.  


Q2. Write a program to accept three numbers and check whether they are 'Pythagorean Triplets' or not.    
If they are Pythagorean Triplets display “'Pythagorean Triplets'” otherwise display “Not a Pythagorean   
Triplets”   (Hint: Use Pythagoras Formula for a Right-angled Triangle: H2 = P2+B2)    

Q3. Klaus wants to know his overall grade, which is calculated based on the average marks he achieved in all six subjects. Write a program to help him to determine the grade based on the following criteria.      A: 90-100%   
B: 80-89%   
C: 70-79%   
D: 60-69%   F: Below 60% Requirements:    
c) The individual marks scored by Klaus in all the six subjects has to be captured   
d) The total and average mark has to be displayed.   
e) Grade has to be displayed based on the average he scored.   



 Q4. Write a program to read an option from user to choose finding area and perimeter of Square, Rectangle and Circle.   
 The application has to provide a menu to the user to choose the options.    
 The application should provide the options continuously to the user till user choose 4th option exit.       
 Hint: You can exit the iterative flow using System.exit(0)      
 Requirements:    
 a) Display the Menu of Geometric shapes   
                1.Square   
                  2.Rectangle   
               3.Circle   
                  4.Exit   
b) Capture the user choice   
c) Capture the user inputs for calculating area and perimeter    
d) Perform the operation based on the user choice    
e) Display the result to the console.    



Q5. Rebecca wants to assist her niece Hope in learning the alphabets. Write a Java program to help Rebecca generate all the uppercase letters using iterative constructs.  


Q6. Write a java program to generate the pattern which is given below.
